# Lab01_Master_MSE_TSM_CloudSys
## Introduction
The goal of this lab is to compare the “functionalities” and “performances” of five Cloud infrastructures (IaaS): AWS Amazon, Google Cloud Engine, Microsoft Azure, SwitchEngine (OpenStack) and Exoscale (CloudStack). To carry out this practice-oriented comparative study, you are asked to deploy a distributed three-tier application of your choice, on the 5 infrastructures. For each IaaS, the deployment is done in two ways:

Manual deployment : by using the GUI of the related IaaS

Automatic deployment: by using the proprietary API of the IaaS.
